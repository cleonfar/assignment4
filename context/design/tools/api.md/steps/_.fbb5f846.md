# concept GrowthTracking

* **purpose** track animal growth information

* **principle**
  a user records growth data like weight for individual animals;
  uses this data to generate reports to track performance and health;
  can give the generated reports to an AI for high level summary and suggests;

* **state**
  * a set of `animals` with
    * an `ID` of type `ID`
    * a set of `WeightRecords` with
      * a `date` of type `Date`
      * a `weight` of type `Number`
      * an optional `notes` of type `String`

  * a set of `Reports` with
    * a `report name` of type `String`
    * a `dateGenerated` of type `Date`
    * a `target` of type `set of IDs`
    * a set of `results` of type `(key-value pairs of data)`
    * an optional `summary` of type `String`

* **actions**
  * `recordWeight (animal: Animal, date: Date, weight: Number, notes: String)`
    * **requires** animal exists
    * **effects** create a new weight record for this animal

  * `removeWeightRecord (animal: Animal, date: Date)`
    * **requires** there is a weight record for this animal on the given date
    * **effects** remove the given weight record from the animal's set of weight records

  * `generateReport (target: String, startDateRange: Date, endDateRange: Date, name: String): (Results: String)`
    * **requires** target animal is in the set of mothers
    * **effects** If no report with this name exists then generate a report on the growth performance of the given animal within the specified date range, otherwise add the growth performance of this animal to the existing report. The report should include each recorded weight of each animal as well as their average daily rate of gain over each time period.

  * `renameReport (oldName: String, newName: String): (newName: String)`
    * **requires** oldName of report exists
    * **effects** renames the specified report

  * `deleteReport (reportName: String)`
    * **requires** report exists
    * **effects** remove the report from the system

  * `aiSummary (reportName: String): (summary: String)`
    * **requires** report exists
    * **effects** The AI generates a summary of the report, highlighting key takeaways and trends shown in the report, and saves it for future viewing
