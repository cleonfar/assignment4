# response:

Here are the TypeScript synchronizations for the `UserAuthentication` and `AnimalIdentity` concepts.

These synchronizations cover the common HTTP request/response patterns for each action, including handling successful outcomes and explicit error responses. They also demonstrate how to use the `where` clause to integrate authentication (`UserAuthentication.verify`) before proceeding with user-scoped `AnimalIdentity` actions.
