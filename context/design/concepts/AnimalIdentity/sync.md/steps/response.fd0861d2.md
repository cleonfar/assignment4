# response:

The trace indicates that your login request is timing out, which means no `Requesting.respond` action is being triggered for that specific request ID (`019a4294-6c1f-7e6c-997c-0661a2038a28`).

The most common reason for this scenario with custom synchronizations is a **mismatch between the HTTP request path sent by the client and the `path` pattern specified in your `when` clauses.**

Let's look at the trace and your `auth.sync.ts` file:

**From your trace:**
The incoming request path is `/UserAuthentification/login`.
The `Requesting.request` action fires with `path: '/UserAuthentification/login'`.

**From your `auth.sync.ts`:**
Your `UserLoginRequest` sync expects the path:

```typescript
export const UserLoginRequest: Sync = ({ request, username, password }) => ({
  when: actions(
    [Requesting.request, { path: "/auth/login", username, password }, { request }], // <-- HERE!
  ),
  then: actions(
    [UserAuthentication.login, { username, password }],
  ),
});
```

The `path` in the `when` clause is `"/auth/login"`.

**The Problem:**
The `Requesting.request` action with `path: '/UserAuthentification/login'` does not match the `when` clause of your `UserLoginRequest` sync, which expects `path: "/auth/login"`. Because there's no match, `UserAuthentication.login` is never called, and consequently, no `Requesting.respond` is ever sent back by your syncs, leading to the timeout.

**Additionally, a potential typo:**
I noticed the path in your trace, `/UserAuthentification/login`, uses `Authentification` (with an `i`). However, your concept is named `UserAuthentication` (without an `i`). This might indicate a typo in your client-side request URL or how concepts are being discovered and exposed as passthrough routes. It's best to be consistent with the actual concept name.

***

### **Solution: Adjust the Client Request Path**

The most straightforward way to resolve this is to ensure your client (the code sending the HTTP request) uses the path that your synchronizations are designed to intercept.

If your application's `REQUESTING_BASE_URL` (from `.env`) is `/api`, then your client should send the login request to:

`POST /api/auth/login`

**Steps:**

1. **Check your client code:** Update the URL your frontend or API client uses for login to `"/api/auth/login"`.
2. **Verify consistency:** Ensure the concept name `UserAuthentication` (without the 'i') is consistently used everywhere. If the `/UserAuthentification/login` path is being generated by a default passthrough mechanism due to a misnamed concept *somewhere*, you might need to find and correct that source. However, for custom syncs, it's always better to explicitly define the paths.
3. **(Optional but recommended for custom routes): Exclude Passthrough Routes:** If you intend to manage *all* authentication logic via your custom syncs, you should explicitly exclude the default passthrough routes for `UserAuthentication` actions in your `src/concepts/Requesting/passthrough.ts` file. For example:
   ```typescript
   // src/concepts/Requesting/passthrough.ts
   export const exclusions = [
     // ... other exclusions
     "/UserAuthentication/register",
     "/UserAuthentication/login",
     "/UserAuthentication/logout",
     // ... potentially also queries if you have custom syncs for them
   ];
   ```
   (Note: use the correct spelling `UserAuthentication` here, not `UserAuthentification`).

By changing the client to hit `/api/auth/login`, your `UserLoginRequest` sync will match the incoming `Requesting.request` action, trigger the `UserAuthentication.login` action, and eventually, either `UserLoginResponse` or `UserLoginErrorResponse` will fire `Requesting.respond`, thus preventing the timeout.
