# response:

Here is a concept specification for a generic `UserAuthentication` concept, following the provided structure and guidelines:

***

**concept** UserAuthentication \[User]

**purpose** Verify a user's identity to grant or deny access to a web account.

**principle** If a user registers with a unique username and a password, and subsequently attempts to log in with those same credentials, they will be successfully authenticated, and the system will identify them as the `User` entity associated with those credentials, enabling access to their account.

**state**
  a set of Users with
    a username String
    a password String

**actions**

  register (username: String, password: String): (user: User)
    **requires** there is no `User` entity 'u' in the set of Users whose `username` property is equal to the input `username`.
    **effects**
      create a new `User` entity 'u'.
      set the `username` property of 'u' to the input `username`.
      set the `password` property of 'u' to the input `password`.
      returns 'u' as `user`.

  login (username: String, password: String): (user: User)
    **requires**
      there exists exactly one `User` entity 'u' in the set of Users such that
      u's `username` property is equal to the input `username` AND
      u's `password` property is equal to the input `password`.
    **effects** Returns the matching `User` entity 'u' as `user`.

  logout (user: User): ()
    **requires** The input `user` exists in the set of Users.
    **effects** No change to the concept's state. (Note: Actual session invalidation would be handled by a separate `Session` concept, as `UserAuthentication` only concerns itself with verifying credentials, not managing active sessions.)
