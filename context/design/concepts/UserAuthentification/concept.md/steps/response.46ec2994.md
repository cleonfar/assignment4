Here is a concept specification for a generic `UserAuthentication` concept, following the provided structure and guidelines:

***

**concept** UserAuthentication \[User]

**purpose** Verify a user's identity to grant or deny access to a web account.

**principle** If a user registers with a unique username and a password, and subsequently attempts to log in with those same credentials, they will be successfully authenticated as that user, enabling access to their account.

**state**
  a set of Users with
    a username String
    a password String
  a set of loggedInUsers User // Represents the set of User entities currently logged in

**actions**

  register (username: String, password: String): (user: User)
    **requires** there is no User 'u' in the set of Users whose username is 'username'
    **effects**
      create a new User entity
      associate 'username' with this new User
      associate 'password' with this new User
      returns the new User entity

  register (username: String, password: String): (error: String)
    **requires** there exists a User 'u' in the set of Users whose username is 'username'
    **effects** returns "Username already taken."

  login (username: String, password: String): (user: User)
    **requires**
      there exists a User 'u' such that u's username is 'username' AND u's password is 'password'
      AND 'u' is not in loggedInUsers
    **effects**
      add 'u' to the set of loggedInUsers
      returns 'u'

  login (username: String, password: String): (error: String)
    **requires**
      (there is no User 'u' such that u's username is 'username' AND u's password is 'password')
      OR
      (there exists a User 'u' such that u's username is 'username' AND u's password is 'password' AND 'u' is already in loggedInUsers)
    **effects** returns "Invalid username or password."

  logout (user: User): (success: Boolean)
    **requires** 'user' is in loggedInUsers
    **effects**
      remove 'user' from loggedInUsers
      returns true

  logout (user: User): (error: String)
    **requires** 'user' is not in loggedInUsers
    **effects** returns "User not logged in."
