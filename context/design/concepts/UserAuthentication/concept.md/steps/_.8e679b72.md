# Concept UserAuthentication

**purpose** Verify a user's identity to grant or deny access to a web account.

**principle** If a user registers with a unique username and a password, and subsequently attempts to log in with those same credentials, they will be successfully authenticated as that user, enabling access to their account.

**state**
  \* a set of `Users` with
    \* a `username` of type `String`
    \* a `password` of type `String`

* a set of `activeSessions` with
  * a session `token` of type `String`
  * a `username` of type `String`

* **actions**
  * `register (username: String, password: String): (user: User)`
    * **requires** there is no User 'u' in the set of Users whose username is 'username'
    * **effects**
      * create a new User entity
      * associate 'username' with this new User
      * associate 'password' with this new User
      * returns the new User entity

  * `login (username: String, password: String): (user: String)`
    * **requires** there exists a User 'u' such that u's username is 'username' AND u's password is 'password'
    * **effects** Returns the user's username.

  * `logout (token: String): Empty`
    * **requires** token is in the set of activeSessions
    * **effect** removes the session from activeSessions

  * `verify (token: String): (user: String)`
    * **requires** the session token is in the set of activeSessions
    * **effects** returns the username associated with the session
