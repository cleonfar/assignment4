# Prompt: Can you add a two part delete herd action? If it is called on an unarchived herd, the herd will be flagged as archived, and if it is called on an archived herd, the herd will be removed. Also, can you split the \_listHerds query into two, one that gives all unarchived herds and another that gives the archived herds?
