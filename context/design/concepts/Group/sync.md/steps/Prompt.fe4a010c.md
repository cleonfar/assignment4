# Prompt: Please write syncs for each of the actions and queries of the HerdGrouping concept so that when a path of the format "/HerdGrouping/ACTION" where ACTION is the action or query in question is called with the arguments to the action, a call is made to UserAuthentication.verify to verify the token and get a user, and then call the action with that user. Make sure that the expected fields in the sync are exactly the inputs to the action associated with that sync.
