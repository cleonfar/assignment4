Got it! Here's the updated `HerdGrouping` concept, incorporating the two-stage `deleteHerd` action and the split listing queries for active and archived herds.

I've also made a minor adjustment to `mergeHerds` to clear the members of the archived herd, consistent with the `deleteHerd` action's archiving behavior.
