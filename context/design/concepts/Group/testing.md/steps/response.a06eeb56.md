# response:

The test is failing because the `splitHerd: should split animals from one herd to another` test expects `ANIMAL_3` to be in `HERD_A` at the beginning of its execution, but based on the preceding test steps, `ANIMAL_3` should have been moved out of `HERD_A`.

Here's a breakdown of the state leading to the failure:

1. **`moveAnimal: should move an animal between herds`**
   * `ANIMAL_3` is added to `HERD_A`.
   * Then, `ANIMAL_3` is moved from `HERD_A` to `HERD_B`.
   * **Result:** `HERD_A` contains `[ANIMAL_2]`. `HERD_B` contains `[ANIMAL_3]`.

2. **`moveAnimal: should *not* return error if animal already in target herd, and ensure it's still there`**
   * `ANIMAL_3` is explicitly added back to `HERD_A` for the setup of this test step.
     * **Result (after add):** `HERD_A` contains `[ANIMAL_2, ANIMAL_3]`.
   * The test then calls `moveAnimal(sourceHerdName: HERD_A, targetHerdName: HERD_B, animal: ANIMAL_3)`.
     * `ANIMAL_3` is in `HERD_A` (source).
     * `ANIMAL_3` is also in `HERD_B` (target) from the earlier step.
     * The action succeeds (as per the new desired behavior, it doesn't error if already in target).
     * **Effect:** `ANIMAL_3` is removed from `HERD_A`. It remains in `HERD_B` (no duplicate added by `$addToSet`).
     * **Result (after this test step):** `HERD_A` contains `[ANIMAL_2]`. `HERD_B` contains `[ANIMAL_3]`.

3. **`splitHerd: should split animals from one herd to another`** (The failing test)
   * At the start of this test, `HERD_A` contains `[ANIMAL_2]`.
   * The test then adds `ANIMAL_4`, `ANIMAL_5`, `ANIMAL_6` to `HERD_A`.
   * **Result:** `HERD_A` now contains `[ANIMAL_2, ANIMAL_4, ANIMAL_5, ANIMAL_6]`.
   * The failing assertion: `assertArrayIncludes(initialHerdA.animals, [ANIMAL_2, ANIMAL_3, ANIMAL_4, ANIMAL_5, ANIMAL_6]);`
     * This assertion *incorrectly* expects `ANIMAL_3` to be in `HERD_A`.

**The fix is to correct the expected array in the `assertArrayIncludes` call at line 377 (after the changes for type narrowing) in the `splitHerd: should split animals from one herd to another` test step, as `ANIMAL_3` should not be present in `HERD_A` at that point.**

Here's the corrected test code:
