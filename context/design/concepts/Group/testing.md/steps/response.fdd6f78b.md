# response:

You are absolutely correct! TypeScript's static analysis needs explicit narrowing for union types, even after an `assertEquals("error" in result, false)` check. While the assertion confirms your expectation at runtime, it doesn't inform the TypeScript compiler that the `result` variable can now be treated solely as the success type.

The solution is to add an `if` condition to explicitly narrow the type. For successful outcomes, if an error is unexpectedly present, we should throw an error in the test to indicate a failure in the concept's behavior or a mistake in the test's assumption.

Here's the corrected `HerdGroupingConcept.test.ts` file with the necessary type narrowing added before accessing success-specific properties like `result.herdName` or `composition.animals`.
