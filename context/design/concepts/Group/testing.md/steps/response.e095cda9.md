# response:

You're suggesting a pragmatic and often desired behavior for bulk operations in real-world applications! It makes sense that for `moveAnimal` and `splitHerd`, the primary concern is that the animals *end up* in the target herd (and are removed from the source), rather than failing if some are already there. The idempotency provided by `$addToSet` in MongoDB perfectly supports this.

Let's update the concept specification, implementation, and tests to reflect this change.

### Revised Concept Specification

I've removed the precondition about the animal *not* being in the target herd for `moveAnimal` and `splitHerd`, and clarified the effects.
