# Prompt: I think I disagree with a few of the tests related to moving animals into a different herd. I would rather not throw an error in that case, and instead just quietly let it happen and not complain that the animal is already in the designated herd. I think if the context of herd management this is more likely to be the desired behavior, because when doing bulk movements I can see situations where the user will want to move a bunch of animals into an existing herd, and most likely would just care that all the moved animals are in the target herd, and not care so much that some of those animals were already there. I will update the implementation to reflect this as well, so please update the tests to handle it.
