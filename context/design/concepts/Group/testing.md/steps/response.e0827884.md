Okay, I understand. You want to modify the `moveAnimal` and `splitHerd` actions so that they gracefully handle cases where an animal intended for the target herd is *already* present in that target herd, rather than throwing an error.

This means we will remove the precondition checks that verify an animal is *not* in the target herd before moving it. MongoDB's `$addToSet` operator (used for adding members) inherently prevents duplicates, so if an animal is already there, it simply won't be added again, making the operation idempotent for that specific animal in the target. The removal from the source herd will still proceed as normal.

Here's the updated `HerdGroupingConcept.ts` with these changes:
