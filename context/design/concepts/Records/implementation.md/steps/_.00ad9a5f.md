# concept Record

* **purpose** track reproductive outcomes and offspring survivability for breeding animals

* **principle**
  a user records birth events for mother animals, optionally linking fathers and offspring;
  later records weaning outcomes for those offspring when the data becomes available;
  and uses this data to evaluate reproductive performance and inform breeding decisions.

* **state**
  * a set of WeightRecords with
    * a `date` of type `Date`
    * a `weight` of type `Number`
    * an optional `notes` of type `String`

  * a set of `BirthRecords` with
    * a `mother` of type `animal`
    * an optional `father` of type `ID`
    * a `birthDate` of type `Date`
    * a set of `offspring` of type `ID`
    * a `countBorn` of type `Number`
      * an optional `notes` of type `String`

  * a set of WeaningRecords with
    * a `mother` of type `ID`
    * a `birthRecord` of type `BirthRecord`
    * a `weaningDate` of type `Date`
    * a `countWeaned` of type `Number`
    * an optional `notes` of type `String`

* **actions**:
  * `recordWeight (animal: Animal, date: Date, weight: Number, notes: String)`
    * **requires** animal exists
    * **effects** create a new weight record for this animal

  * `viewWeightHistory (animal: Animal): (records: Set<WeightRecord>)`
    * **requires** animal exists
    * **effects** return all weight records for this animal

  * `recordBirth (mother: Animal, father: Animal?, birthDate: Date, offspring: Set<Animal>, countBorn: Number, notes: String?)`
    * **requires** mother exists and all offspring exist
    * **effects** create a new birth record and link offspring to mother and optional father

  * `recordWeaning (birthRecord: BirthRecord, weaningDate: Date, countWeaned: Number, notes: String?)`
    * **requires** birthRecord exists and weaningDate is after birthDate
    * **effects** create a new weaning record linked to the birth record

  * `viewBirths (animal: Animal): (records: Set<BirthRecord>)`
    * **requires** animal exists
    * **effects** return all birth records where this animal is the mother or father

  * `viewWeaning (birthRecord: BirthRecord): (record: WeaningRecord?)`
    * **requires** birthRecord exists
    * **effects** return the weaning record associated with this birth, if any

  * `updateBirthRecord (birthRecord: BirthRecord, birthDate: Date?, offspring: Set<Animal>?, countBorn: Number?, notes: String?)`
    * **requires** birthRecord exists
    * **effects** update any provided fields in the birth record and leave the rest unchanged
