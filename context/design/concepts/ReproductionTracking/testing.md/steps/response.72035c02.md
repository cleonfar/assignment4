# response:

Okay, let's update the tests for the `generateReport` action to reflect its new return type (`{ results?: string[]; error?: string }`) and the updated `Report` interface where `target` is now an array (`ID[]`).

I will also include minor adjustments for the `_viewReport` and `_aiSummary` tests to ensure they align with the `target: ID[]` structure and the new return type.
