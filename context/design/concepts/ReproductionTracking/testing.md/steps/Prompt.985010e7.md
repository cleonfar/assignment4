# Prompt: Everything is looking great except for the following, which has this error at \_id Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'ObjectId'.deno-ts(2322). Try to fix this. ONLY give the lines of code that are need to make this one small fix. Absolutely do not output the entire test suite to do this one little fix.

```
  // M_ERR_WEANED_MORE: Simulate weaned > born (1 born, 2 weaned)
  // Will be detected by the AI's rule: totalOffspringWeaned > totalOffspringBorn
  const { litter: lEW } = await concept.recordLitter({ motherId: motherErrorWeanedMore, birthDate: new Date("2023-02-01"), reportedLitterSize: 2 });
  const { offspring: oEW1 } = await concept.recordOffspring({ litterId: lEW!._id, offspringId: `${motherErrorWeanedMore}_o1`, sex: Sex.Female });
  await concept.recordWeaning({ offspringId: oEW1!._id });
  // Manually insert a record for another offspring that is weaned but not born to simulate the error.
  // `generateReport` will see 2 weaned, but only 1 born for this litter.
  await db.collection("ReproductionTracking.offspring").insertOne({
