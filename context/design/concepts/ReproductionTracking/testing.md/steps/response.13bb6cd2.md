# response:

Okay, let's add comprehensive test cases for the `generateReport` action. This will involve setting up mothers, litters, and offspring to ensure the report generation and update logic behaves as expected.

I will also update the `_aiSummary` test case to reflect the change where the `report.target` is now an `ID[]` instead of a single `ID`.
