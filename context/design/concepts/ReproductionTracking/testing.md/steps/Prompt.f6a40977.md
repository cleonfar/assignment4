# Prompt: this didn't really fix anything, now I just have this issue Conversion of type 'Litter' to type 'Record\<PropertyKey, unknown>' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other. If this was intentional, convert the expression to 'unknown' first.

Index signature for type 'string' is missing in type 'Litter'.deno-ts(2352)
