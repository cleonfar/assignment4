# trace: Fulfilling the Principle of ReproductionTracking

The principle states:
"a user records birth events for mother animals, optionally linking fathers and offspring; later records weaning outcomes for those offspring when the data becomes available; uses this data to generate reports to evaluate reproductive performance and inform breeding decisions; can choose to generate an AI summary of generated reports to aide in understanding and decision making;"

Here's a step-by-step trace demonstrating how these actions fulfill the concept's principle:

1. **Preparation: Initialize the system and add breeding animals.**
   * **Action**: `addMother` (for `breeding_female_A`)
     * `concept.addMother({ mother: "breeding_female_A" });`
   * **Action**: `addMother` (for `breeding_male_B` - as a father)
     * `concept.addMother({ mother: "breeding_male_B" });`
   * **Expected State**: `breeding_female_A` and `breeding_male_B` are registered as mother-capable animals in the system.

2. **Record Birth Event:** The user observes a birth and records it.
   * **Action**: `recordBirth`
     * `const litter1_birth_date = new Date("2024-03-10T08:00:00Z");`
     * `const offspring_ids = [freshID(), freshID(), freshID(), freshID()];`
     * `concept.recordBirth({`
     * `  mother: "breeding_female_A",`
     * `  father: "breeding_male_B",`
     * `  birthDate: litter1_birth_date,`
     * `  offspring: offspring_ids,`
     * `  countBorn: 4,`
     * `  sex: "mixed",` // (Assuming 'mixed' or a primary sex, as per current design)
     * `  notes: "Healthy litter, 2 males, 2 females.",`
     * `});`
   * **Expected State**: A new `BirthRecord` document is created, linking `breeding_female_A` (and `breeding_male_B`) to the `offspring_ids`. These `offspring_ids` are also registered as individual `offspring` in the system.

3. **Record Weaning Outcome:** Weeks or months later, the user records the weaning event for the litter.
   * **Action**: `recordWeaning`
     * `const birthRecordId = (await concept.viewBirths({ animal: "breeding_female_A" })).records[0]._id;` // Retrieve the birth record ID
     * `const weaning_date = new Date("2024-05-01T12:00:00Z");`
     * `concept.recordWeaning({`
     * `  birthRecordId: birthRecordId,`
     * `  weaningDate: weaning_date,`
     * `  countWeaned: 3,` // One offspring did not survive
     * `  notes: "One offspring lost due to illness, remaining three healthy.",`
     * `});`
   * **Expected State**: A new `WeaningRecord` document is created, linked to the `BirthRecord`, indicating 3 out of 4 offspring survived until weaning.

4. **Generate a Reproductive Performance Report:** The user wants to evaluate `breeding_female_A`'s performance.
   * **Action**: `generateReport`
     * `const report_start_date = new Date("2024-01-01T00:00:00Z");`
     * `const report_end_date = new Date("2024-06-01T00:00:00Z");`
     * `const reportResult = await concept.generateReport({`
     * `  target: ["breeding_female_A"],`
     * `  startDateRange: report_start_date,`
     * `  endDateRange: report_end_date,`
     * `});`
     * `const generatedReportId = reportResult.report._id;`
   * **Expected State**: A `GeneratedReport` document is created, containing mocked data about `breeding_female_A`'s reproductive performance within the specified date range, including birth counts and weaning rates (from the mocked `results` field).

5. **View the Report:** The user reviews the generated report.
   * **Action**: `viewReport`
     * `const viewedReport = await concept.viewReport({ reportId: generatedReportId });`
   * **Expected Output**: The `viewedReport.results` object will contain the detailed (mocked) data, allowing the user to see the birth count, weaning rate, and other relevant metrics for `breeding_female_A`, informing breeding decisions.

6. **Generate AI Summary for Decision Making:** To quickly grasp key insights, the user requests an AI summary.
   * **Action**: `aiSummary`
     * `const aiSummaryResult = await concept.aiSummary({ reportId: generatedReportId });`
   * **Expected State**: The `GeneratedReport` document is updated with a `summary` field containing the AI-generated text.
   * **Expected Output**: The `aiSummaryResult.summary` string provides a concise overview of the report's findings, highlighting strengths or areas for improvement in `breeding_female_A`'s performance.

7. **Review the Report with AI Summary:** The user can now view the report again, benefiting from the added AI insight.
   * **Action**: `viewReport`
     * `const reviewedReportWithSummary = await concept.viewReport({ reportId: generatedReportId });`
   * **Expected Output**: The `reviewedReportWithSummary.results` object now includes the `summary` field, making it easier for the user to understand key takeaways and inform future breeding choices.

This trace effectively demonstrates the full cycle of the `ReproductionTracking` concept, from data entry to analysis and decision support, as outlined in its principle.
