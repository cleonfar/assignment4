# Prompt: Try to write some tests for the AI related actions. The AI actions are already implemented, I just want test cases that will call these actions, which themselves will call and external AI api. Check to make sure the AI is correctly identifying obvious high or low performers. Also ensure AI handles large reports well, and that it correctly identifies some obvious record errors. Take advantage of the fact that the AI responses are formatted in JSON to test them.
