# response:

To avoid the specific `Offspring` type while still correctly typing the `insertOne` call for MongoDB, you can cast the collection to a more generic `Collection<Record<string, any>>`. This tells TypeScript to treat the document as a generic object with string keys and any values, bypassing the default assumption of `ObjectId` for `_id`.

```typescript
// file: src/ReproductionTracking/ReproductionTrackingConcept.test.ts
// ...

    await t.step("should handle noticing record errors well", async () => {
      const motherErrorWeanedMore = "M_ERR_WEANED_MORE";
      // ... (other mother definitions)

      await concept.addMother({ motherId: motherErrorWeanedMore });
      // ... (other mother additions)

      // M_ERR_WEANED_MORE: Simulate weaned > born (1 born, 2 weaned)
      // Will be detected by the AI's rule: totalOffspringWeaned > totalOffspringBorn
      const { litter: lEW } = await concept.recordLitter({ motherId: motherErrorWeanedMore, birthDate: new Date("2023-02-01"), reportedLitterSize: 2 });
      const { offspring: oEW1 } = await concept.recordOffspring({ litterId: lEW!._id, offspringId: `${motherErrorWeanedMore}_o1`, sex: Sex.Female });
      await concept.recordWeaning({ offspringId: oEW1!._id });
      // Manually insert a record for another offspring that is weaned but not born to simulate the error.
      // `generateReport` will see 2 weaned, but only 1 born for this litter.
      await (db.collection("ReproductionTracking.offspring") as Collection<Record<string, any>>).insertOne({
          _id: `${motherErrorWeanedMore}_o2`,
          litterId: lEW!._id, // Linked to the same litter
          sex: Sex.Male,
          notes: "Simulated extra weaned offspring",
          isAlive: true,
          survivedTillWeaning: true,
      });

      // ... (rest of the aiSummary test step)
```
