# ReproductionTracking Concept Specification Update

First, let's update the concept specification to reflect these changes.

* **concept** ReproductionTracking
  * **purpose** track reproductive outcomes and offspring survivability for breeding animals

  * **principle**
    a user records birth events for mother animals, optionally linking fathers and offspring;
    later records weaning outcomes for those offspring when the data becomes available;
    uses this data to generate reports to evaluate reproductive performance and inform breeding decisions;
    can choose to generate an AI summary of generated reports to aide in understanding and decision making;

  * **state**
    * a set of `mothers` with
      * an `ID` of type `ID`
      * an optional `notes` of type `String`

    * a set of `offspring` with
      * an `ID` of type `ID`
      * an optional `fatherId` of type `ID`
      * a `birthDate` of type `Date`
      * a `sex` of type `Enum [male, female, neutered]`
      * an optional `notes` of type `String`
      * a `isAlive` of type `Bool`
      * a `survivedTillWeaning` of type `Bool`

    * a set of `GeneratedReports` with
      * a `report name` of type `String`
      * a `dateGenerated` of type `Date`
      * a `target` of type `Set<ID>`
      * a set of `results` of type `(key-value pairs or tabular data)`

  * **actions**:
    * `addMother (motherId: ID): (motherId: ID)`
      * **requires** mother is not already in the set of mothers
      * **effects** mother is added to the set of mothers

    * `removeMother (motherId: ID): (motherId: ID)`
      * **requires** a mother with this ID is in the set of mothers
      * **effects** removes this mother from the set of mothers

    * `recordBirth (motherId: ID, fatherId: ID?, birthDate: Date, offspringId: ID, sex: Enum [male, female, neutered], notes: String?): (offspring: Offspring)`
      * **effects** adds the recorded offspring to the set of offspring. Also adds the mother to the set of mothers if she isn't there already

    * `updateBirth (offspringId: ID, birthDate: Date?, fatherId: ID?, motherId: ID?, sex: Enum?, notes: String?): (offspring: Offspring)`
      * **requires** There is an offspring with the given ID
      * **effects** Updates any given information about the offspring's birth. If the mother is changed, move the offspring to the new mother's set off offspring, adding the mother to the set of mothers if necessary.

    * `recordWeaning (offspringId: ID): offspringId: ID`
      * **requires** offspring is in the set of offspring and is alive
      * **effects** Sets survived until weaning to be true

    * `recordDeath (offspringId: ID): (offspringId: ID)`
      * **requires** offspring is in the set of offspring and is currently living
      * **effects** Sets the alive flag of this offspring to false

    * `viewOffspring (motherId: ID): (offspring: Set<Offspring>)`
      * **requires** animal exists
      * **effects** return the IDs of all offspring

    * `generateReport (target: Set<ID>, startDateRange: Date, endDateRange: Date, name: String?): (report: GeneratedReport)`
      * **requires** All target animals are in the set of mothers
      * **effects** produce a report on the reproductive performance of the given animals within the specified date range

    * `renameReport (oldName: String, newName: String): (report: GeneratedReport)`
      * **requires** oldName of report exists
      * **effects** renames the specified report

    * `viewReport (reportName: String): (report: GeneratedReport)`
      * **requires** report with the given name exists
      * **effects** returns the summary and results of the report

    * `listReports (): (reports: Set<GeneratedReport>)`
      * **effects** return all generated reports

    * `deleteReport (reportName: String)`
      * **requires** report exists
      * **effects** remove the report from the system

    * `aiSummary (reportName: String): (summary: String)`
      * **requires** report exists
      * **effects** The ai takes the report and gives a summary of the report, highlighting key takeaways and trends shown in the report.
