# response:

Thank you for providing the "ReproductionTracking" concept! Now I can properly critique its `*state*` section against the Simple State Form (SSF) specification you provided earlier.

Overall, the concept's `purpose` and `principles` are clear, and the `actions` section outlines the functionality well. However, the `*state*` section, which is meant to use SSF, has several deviations from the specified grammar, lexical rules, and semantic intentions of SSF.

Here's a breakdown of the critique, with specific suggestions for bringing it into compliance with SSF:

## Critique of `*state*` Section against SSF Specification

The `*state*` section of your "ReproductionTracking" concept is:

```
* **state**
  * a set of `mothers` with
    * an `ID` of type `ID`

    * a set of `offspring`

    * a set of `offspring` with
      * an `ID` of type `ID`
      * an optional `father` of type `ID`
      * a `birthDate` of type `Date`
      * a `sex` of type `Enum [male, female, neutered]`
      * a `countBorn` of type `Number`
      * an optional `notes` of type `String`
      * a `survivedTillWeaning` of type `Bool`
```

### 1. **Formatting and Indentation (Lexical Considerations: Layout)**

* **Deviation:** The use of `*` (asterisks) for bullet points is not part of the SSF syntax. SSF relies purely on whitespace indentation to define hierarchy.
* **Suggestion:** Remove all `*` characters and use only spaces for indentation.

### 2. **Type Naming and Capitalization (Lexical Considerations: Identifiers)**

* **Deviation:** `mothers` and `offspring` are used in lowercase when defining their sets (`a set of `mothers\`). SSF states: "A *subset-name*, *object-type*, *parameter-type* or *primitive-type* must start with an upper case alphabetic character."
* **Suggestion:** Change `mothers` to `Mothers` and `offspring` to `Offspring` when referring to the type of the set. Field names (like `father`, `birthDate`) should remain lowercase.

### 3. **The `ID` Type (Grammar & Lexical Considerations)**

* **Deviation:** `ID` is used as a type (`an ID of type ID`, `father of type ID`). However, `ID` is **not** one of the `primitive-type`s defined in SSF (`Number`, `String`, `Flag`, `Date`, `DateTime`), nor is it declared as an `object-type` itself.
* **Suggestion 1 (If `ID` is a primitive value):** You must either:
  * Extend the SSF specification's `primitive-type` list to explicitly include `ID`.
  * Or, specify that `ID` is an alias for an existing primitive type (e.g., `String` or `Number`). For example: `an ID String`.
* **Suggestion 2 (If `ID` refers to another object):** If `ID` is meant to refer to an *animal object* (e.g., `mother` or `father` referring to an actual `Animal` entity), then the field should be typed as that object, not `ID`. For example, `an optional father Animals` (assuming `Animals` is a declared set). Given `ReproductionTracking` is about "breeding animals", it's highly likely `father` refers to an `Animal` entity.

### 4. **"of type" Clause (Grammar: `field-decl`)**

* **Deviation:** The phrase "`of type`" (e.g., `an ID of type ID`, `a sex of type Enum [...]`, `survivedTillWeaning of type Bool`) is not part of the `field-decl` grammar in SSF. The type simply follows the field name.
* **Suggestion:** Remove "`of type`".
  * Example: `a username String` (not `a username of type String`).
  * So, `an ID ID` (or `an ID String`), `a sex Enum [...]`, `a survivedTillWeaning Bool`.

### 5. **Enumeration Syntax (Grammar: `enumeration-type`)**

* **Deviation:** The syntax `Enum [male, female, neutered]` is not compliant with the SSF `enumeration-type` grammar: `*enumeration-type* ::= "of" (*enum-constant* "or" )+ *enum-constant*`.
* **Suggestion:** Change `a sex of type Enum [male, female, neutered]` to `a sex of MALE or FEMALE or NEUTERED`. Remember that `enum-constant`s must be uppercase as per SSF lexical rules.

### 6. **Boolean Type (Lexical Considerations: Identifiers - Primitive Types)**

* **Deviation:** `Bool` is used for `survivedTillWeaning`. SSF specifies `Flag` as the primitive type for boolean values.
* **Suggestion:** Change `Bool` to `Flag`.

### 7. **Fundamental Structural Issue: Defining `Offspring` (Grammar & Semantic Features)**

This is the most critical point for SSF compliance.

```
  * a set of `mothers` with
    * an `ID` of type `ID` // [A] Field 'ID' for Mothers

    * a set of `offspring` // [B] Implicitly named field 'offspring', type 'set of Offspring'

    * a set of `offspring` with // [C] ANOTHER field named 'offspring', AND defines Offspring structure
      * an `ID` of type `ID`
      * ... (all offspring fields)
```

* **Deviation 1: Redundant Field Name & Uniqueness Violation:**
  * Line \[B] implicitly declares a field named `offspring` (from `a set of offspring`).
  * Line \[C] *also* implicitly declares a field named `offspring` (from `a set of offspring with...`).
  * This violates the SSF grammar constraint: "The *field-names* within a `set-decl` or `subset-decl` must be unique." (And more generally, "within all the decls that are in the hierarchy beneath a `set-decl`, *field-names* must be unique," which I clarified in our previous discussion to mean unique for a given object type).
* **Deviation 2: Incorrect Type Definition Strategy:** SSF defines types (sets) *globally*. You declare `a set of Users` and then `a set of Profiles`, and then `Users` has `a Profile`. You don't define the *structure* of `Profile` directly nested inside the `Users` declaration. Your `*state*` section is attempting to define the `Offspring` object type *inside* the `Mothers` declaration.
* **Semantic Problem:** SSF's "sets and relations" view implies that `Offspring` should be a standalone set of objects, and then `Mothers` can have a relation (`a set of Offspring`) that links to them. This allows `Offspring` to potentially be related to other entities (e.g., a `Father` object) or exist independently if needed.
* **Suggestion:**
  1. Define `Offspring` as its own top-level set (`a set of Offspring with ...`).
  2. Inside `Mothers`, declare *one* field that relates `Mothers` to this globally defined `Offspring` set.

## Proposed Revised `*state*` Section in SSF

Considering all the above, hereâ€™s how the `*state*` section could be rewritten to adhere to SSF:

```
// Define the primary entity types (sets) globally first, with capitalized names.
// Assuming 'Animal' is a base type for both mothers and offspring for better relation modeling.

a set of Animals with
  an animalID String // Assuming 'ID' maps to String, and using 'animalID' for clarity as a field name
  // ... any other common fields for all animals (e.g., a name String, a dob Date)

// Mothers are a classification (subset) of Animals, inheriting 'animalID' and other Animal fields.
a Mothers set of Animals with
  // A Mother has a relation to her Offspring.
  // This field implicitly creates a relation named 'offspring' of type 'set of Offspring'.
  a set of Offspring

// Offspring are also Animals, and their specific fields are defined here.
a set of Offspring with
  an offspringID String // Another 'ID' field, perhaps distinct for offspring or just 'animalID'
  an optional father Animals // The father is an Animal.
                             // This implies 'father' is a field relating an Offspring to an Animal object.
  a birthDate Date
  a sex of MALE or FEMALE or NEUTERED // Correct enumeration syntax
  a countBorn Number
  an optional notes String
  a survivedTillWeaning Flag // Using Flag for boolean
  // A field to relate offspring back to their mother could also be added here if desired:
  // a mother Mothers

// If BirthRecords, WeaningRecords, and GeneratedReports are entities that are stored,
// they should also be declared as sets.

a set of BirthRecords with
  a mother Mothers
  an optional father Animals
  a set of Offspring // A birth record is associated with a set of offspring
  a birthDate Date
  a countBorn Number
  an optional notes String

a set of WeaningRecords with
  a birthRecord BirthRecords // Links to a specific BirthRecord
  a weaningDate Date
  a countWeaned Number
  an optional notes String

a set of GeneratedReports with
  a generatedOn Date
  a target set of Animals // Or set of Mothers/Offspring if the report targets specific types
  a startDateRange Date
  a endDateRange Date
  a results String // Store the actual report content as a string
```

### Explanation of Changes and Additional Points:

1. **Global Type Definitions:** `Animals`, `Mothers`, `Offspring`, `BirthRecords`, `WeaningRecords`, and `GeneratedReports` are all declared as top-level `sets`. This aligns with SSF's philosophy of defining entities and then linking them with relations.
2. **`Mothers` as a Subset:** `a Mothers set of Animals` clearly indicates that `Mothers` are a specialized kind of `Animal`, inheriting characteristics from `Animals` and adding their own specific relations (like `a set of Offspring`).
3. **Correct Field Naming and Typing:**
   * `animalID`, `offspringID` used as field names (lowercase) with `String` type (as `ID` is not a primitive type).
   * `an optional father Animals` clearly states that the `father` field relates an `Offspring` to an `Animal` object.
   * `a sex of MALE or FEMALE or NEUTERED` uses the correct `enumeration-type` syntax.
   * `a survivedTillWeaning Flag` uses the correct `primitive-type` for booleans.
4. **No "of type":** The phrase `of type` has been removed.
5. **Implicit Field Names:** `a set of Offspring` within `Mothers` implicitly creates a field named `offspring`, linking the mother to her offspring.
6. **Explicit Records:** The `actions` section mentions `BirthRecord`, `WeaningRecord`, and `GeneratedReport`. To be part of the SSF state, these also need to be declared as sets, detailing their structure and how they relate to other entities (e.g., `BirthRecords` links to `Mothers`, `Offspring`).

By making these adjustments, your "ReproductionTracking" state model will be much clearer, more consistent with the SSF specification, and easier to translate into various database schemas.
