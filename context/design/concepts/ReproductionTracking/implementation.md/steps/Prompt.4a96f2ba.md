# Prompt: There is now this error on the line that says this:     const updateResult: ModifyResult<Offspring> | null = await this.offspring

Don't rewrite all the code if it's not necessary, just the part where the issue is
Type 'WithId<Offspring> | null' is not assignable to type 'ModifyResult<Offspring> | null'.
Type 'WithId<Offspring>' is not assignable to type 'ModifyResult<Offspring> | null'.deno-ts(2322)
