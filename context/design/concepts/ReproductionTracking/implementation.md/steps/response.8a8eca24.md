# response:

Based on the `recordOffspring` action in the `ReproductionTrackingConcept` implementation:

The `survivedTillWeaning` property of an offspring is initialized to `false` when an offspring record is first created using the `recordOffspring` action. It is later set to `true` by the `recordWeaning` action if the offspring is alive at that point.
