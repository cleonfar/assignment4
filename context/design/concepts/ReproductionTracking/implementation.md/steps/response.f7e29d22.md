# response:

That's an excellent question, and it gets at a fundamental point of good software design and type safety in TypeScript!

You *could* absolutely use `string` for all your `ID`s, and your code would technically function. TypeScript would still allow string comparisons, assignments, etc.

However, there are several very good reasons why using a distinct `ID` type (even if it's just a type alias for `string` under the hood) is a better practice:

1. **Semantic Clarity and Domain Modeling:**
   * When you see `motherId: ID`, you immediately understand its *purpose*: it's a unique identifier for a mother.
   * If you just see `motherId: string`, it's less clear. Is it a name? A code? Using `ID` clearly communicates its role within your domain. This makes your code more readable and self-documenting.

2. **Future-Proofing and Flexibility:**
   * Right now, `ID` likely maps to a `string` (e.g., a UUID or `ObjectId.toHexString()`). But what if your ID strategy changes in the future?
     * Maybe you switch to a custom ID object `interface ID { value: string; type: "uuid" | "numeric" }`.
     * Maybe you want to wrap MongoDB's `ObjectId` directly in your `ID` type.
   * If you've used `ID` everywhere, you only need to change the *definition* of `ID` in `utils/types.ts` and potentially the `freshID` function. If you'd used `string` directly, you'd have to find and replace `string` with your new type *everywhere* an ID is used, which is error-prone and tedious. This is arguably the biggest benefit.

3. **Preventing Accidental Misuse (Subtle Type Safety):**
   * While TypeScript doesn't prevent assigning *any* string to `motherId: ID` if `ID` is `type ID = string`, it sets the intention.
   * More advanced techniques exist (like "branded types" or "nominal typing" in TypeScript) that can make `ID` a truly distinct type, even if it's `string` at runtime.
     ```typescript
     // Example of a branded type
     type MotherId = string & { readonly __brand: unique symbol };
     function createMotherId(value: string): MotherId {
       return value as MotherId;
     }
     // Now you can't assign an arbitrary string to MotherId without casting
     ```
   * Even without branded types, having `ID` as a specific type alias for `string` means that if you later decide to, say, make `litterId` a `number` or `object` type, TypeScript will help you catch errors where you might accidentally try to compare a `motherId` (string) with a `litterId` (number).

4. **Consistency Across Concepts:**
   * If you have other concepts in your system, they will likely also have `ID`s for their entities. Using a universal `ID` type across your entire application ensures a consistent way of referring to primary keys, regardless of the specific domain.

5. **Readability in Function Signatures:**
   * `addMother({ motherId: ID })` is clearer than `addMother({ motherId: string })` when scanning function definitions, as it tells you the *role* of that string parameter.

**In summary:**

While using `string` might *feel* slightly easier initially because it requires one less `import ID` and you're not introducing a new type name, the `ID` type provides **significant long-term benefits in terms of maintainability, readability, flexibility, and architectural robustness.**

It's a very common and recommended practice in TypeScript to define specific types for identifiers, even if they're just aliases for primitive types like `string` or `number`. You're doing it the "right" way by using `ID`.
