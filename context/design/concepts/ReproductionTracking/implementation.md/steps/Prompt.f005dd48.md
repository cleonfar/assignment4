# Prompt: Was there something unclear in the concept spec that made you originally believe that generated reports should not have per-mother data? I would have thought that that was obvious. Just to be clear, at the very least the generated report should give for each mother that has data in the date range their average litter size and the average litter size that they have kept alive until weaning.
