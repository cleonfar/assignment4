# concept ReproductionTracking

* **purpose** track reproductive outcomes and offspring survivability for breeding animals

* **principle**
  a user records birth events for mother animals, optionally linking fathers and offspring;
  later records weaning outcomes for those offspring when the data becomes available;
  uses this data to generate reports to evaluate reproductive performance and inform breeding decisions;
  can choose to generate an AI summary of generated reports to aide in understanding and decision making;

* **state**
  * a set of `mothers` with
    * an `ID` of type `ID`

    * a set of `offspring`

    * a set of `offspring` with
      * an `ID` of type `ID`
      * an optional `father` of type `ID`
      * a `birthDate` of type `Date`
      * a `sex` of type `Enum [male, female, neutered]`
      * a `countBorn` of type `Number`
      * an optional `notes` of type `String`
      * a `survivedTillWeaning` of type `Bool`

* **actions**:
  * `addMother (mother: ID): mother: ID`
    * **requires** mother is not already in the set of mothers

  * `recordBirth (mother: ID, father: ID?, birthDate: Date, offspring: Set<ID>, countBorn: Number, notes: String?)`
    * **requires** mother exists and all offspring exist
    * **effects** create a new birth record and link offspring to mother and optional father

  * `recordWeaning (birthRecord: BirthRecord, weaningDate: Date, countWeaned: Number, notes: String?)`
    * **requires** birthRecord exists and weaningDate is after birthDate
    * **effects** create a new weaning record linked to the birth record

  * `viewBirths (animal: ID): (records: Set<BirthRecord>)`
    * **requires** animal exists
    * **effects** return all birth records where this animal is the mother

  * `viewWeaning (birthRecord: BirthRecord): (record: WeaningRecord?)`
    * **requires** birthRecord exists
    * **effects** return the weaning record associated with this birth, if any

  * `updateBirthRecord (birthRecord: BirthRecord, birthDate: Date?, offspring: Set<ID>?, countBorn: Number?, notes: String?)`
    * **requires** birthRecord exists

    * **effects** update any provided fields in the birth record and leave the rest unchanged

    * `generateReport (target: Set<ID>, startDateRange: Date, endDateRange: Date): (report: GeneratedReport)`

    * **requires** All target animals are in the set of animals

    * **effects** produce a report based on the specified parameters and store the results

  * `viewReport (report: GeneratedReport): (results: GeneratedReport)`
    * **requires** report exists
    * **effects** return the summary and results of the report

  * `listReports (): (reports: Set<GeneratedReport>)`
    * **effects** return all generated reports

  * `deleteReport (report: GeneratedReport)`
    * **requires** report exists
    * **effects** remove the report from the system

  * `aiSummary (report: Report): (summary: String)`
    * **requires** report exists
    * **effects** The ai takes the report and gives a summary of the report, highlighting key
      takeaways and trends shown in the report.
