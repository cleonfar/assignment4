Ah, a classic and wonderful question!

**Why is the sky blue?**

The reason the sky appears blue is due to a phenomenon called **Rayleigh scattering**. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Sunlight is White Light:** Sunlight, as it reaches Earth, is composed of all the colors of the rainbow (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet – the visible spectrum). When combined, these colors appear white to our eyes.

2. **Earth's Atmosphere:** Our atmosphere is made up of tiny gas molecules, primarily nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2).

3. **Scattering:** When sunlight enters the atmosphere, it collides with these tiny gas molecules. These molecules are much smaller than the wavelengths of visible light. When light hits them, it gets scattered (deflected) in different directions.

4. **Wavelength Matters:** Shorter wavelengths of light (like blue and violet) are scattered much more effectively and intensely by these small molecules than longer wavelengths (like red and yellow). Think of it like a ripple effect – the shorter, choppier waves are disrupted more easily.

5. **Why Blue, Not Violet?** While violet light is scattered even more than blue, our eyes are more sensitive to blue light, and there's also slightly more blue light coming from the sun than violet. So, we perceive the sky as blue.

6. **The Result:** Because blue light is scattered in all directions throughout the atmosphere, wherever you look in the sky, you're seeing this scattered blue light, making the sky appear blue.

This also explains why sunsets are red or orange! When the sun is low on the horizon, its light has to travel through a much thicker layer of atmosphere. Most of the blue light has already been scattered away, leaving the longer-wavelength red and orange light to reach our eyes directly.
