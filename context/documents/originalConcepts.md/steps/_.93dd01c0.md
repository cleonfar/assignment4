# Original Concept Specs

concept AnimalIdentity
purpose represent individual animals with persistent identifiers and core attributes\
principle\
a user registers animals to track them individually across their lifecycle;\
assigns each animal a unique tag and records identifying details;\
updates status to reflect key transitions such as sale, death, or transfer;\
and uses this identity to link the animal to other concepts like herd membership, production metrics, and lifecycle events.

state\
a set of Animals with\
an id tag String\
a breed String\
a sex Enum \[male, female, unknown]\
a status Enum \[alive, sold, deceased]\
a notes (Set of Strings)\
an optional birthDate Date\
an optional mother Animal\
an optional father Animal\
an optional set of offspring (Set of Animals)

actions\
registerAnimal (owner: User, tag: String, species: String, breed: String, birthDate: Date, sex: Enum): (animal: Animal)\
effects create a new animal with this owner and attributes, status set to alive

```
updateStatus (animal: Animal, status: Enum, notes: String)  
  requires animal exists  
  effects set the animal’s status to the new value and record optional notes  

editDetails (animal: Animal, species: String, breed: String, birthDate: Date, sex: Enum)  
  requires animal exists  
  effects update the animal’s identifying attributes  

viewAnimal (tag: Tag): (animal: Animal)  
  requires an animal with this tag exists  
  effects return the animal and its attributes  

listAnimals (owner: User): (animals: Set<Animal>)  
  effects return all animals owned by this user  
```

concept HerdGrouping \[Animal]\
purpose: organize animals into dynamic groupings for operational and analytical purposes\
principle:\
a user creates herds to group animals based on location, purpose, or management strategy;\
adds or removes animals from herds as conditions change;\
merges herds when combining groups, or splits them to separate animals;\
moves animals between herds to reflect real-world transitions;\
and views herd composition and history to support planning and analysis.

state\
a set of Herds with\
an owner User\
a name String\
a location String\
a set of Animals

actions
createHerd (owner: User, name: String, location: String): (herd: Herd)
effects create a new herd with this owner, name, location, and no members

```
addAnimal (herd: Herd, animal: Animal)
  requires herd exists and animal exists
  effects add the animal to the herd and record an add event

removeAnimal (herd: Herd, animal: Animal)
  requires herd exists and animal is a member
  effects remove the animal from the herd and record a remove event

moveAnimal (source: Herd, target: Herd, animal: Animal)
  requires both herds exist and animal is a member of source
  effects remove the animal from source, add to target, and record a move event

mergeHerds (source: Herd, target: Herd)
  requires both herds exist
  effects move all animals from source to target, record a merge event, and archive source and target herd.

splitHerd (source: Herd, target: Herd, animals: Set<Animal>)
  requires both herds exist and all animals are members of source
  effects move specified animals from source to target and record a split event

viewComposition (herd: Herd): (animals: Set<Animal>)
  requires herd exists
  effects return current members of the herd
```

concept: GrowthRecords \[Animal]
purpose: track growth and feeding data for animals raised for meat production
principle:\
a user records performance data such as weight and feed consumption for individual animals;
may record these metrics together or separately, depending on available data;
uses this data to monitor rate of gain and feed efficiency;

state:\
a set of animals with\
a set of WeightRecords with\
a date Date\
a weight Number\
an optional notes String

actions:\
recordWeight (animal: Animal, date: Date, weight: Number, notes: String)\
requires animal exists\
effects create a new weight record for this animal

```
viewWeightHistory (animal: Animal): (records: Set<WeightRecord>)  
  requires animal exists  
  effects return all weight records for this animal  
```

concept ReproductiveRecords \[Animal]
purpose track reproductive outcomes and offspring survivability for breeding animals
principle
a user records birth events for mother animals, optionally linking fathers and offspring;
later records weaning outcomes for those offspring when the data becomes available;
and uses this data to evaluate reproductive performance and inform breeding decisions.

state
a set of BirthRecords with\
a mother animal
an optional father Animal\
a birthDate Date\
a set of offspring Animals\
a countBorn Number\
an optional notes String

```
a set of WeaningRecords with  
  a mother animal
  a birthRecord BirthRecord  
  a weaningDate Date  
  a countWeaned Number  
  an optional notes String  
```

actions:\
recordBirth (mother: Animal, father: Animal?, birthDate: Date, offspring: Set<Animal>, countBorn: Number, notes: String?)\
requires: mother exists and all offspring exist\
effects: create a new birth record and link offspring to mother and optional father

```
recordWeaning (birthRecord: BirthRecord, weaningDate: Date, countWeaned: Number, notes: String?)  
  requires: birthRecord exists and weaningDate is after birthDate  
  effects: create a new weaning record linked to the birth record  

viewBirths (animal: Animal): (records: Set<BirthRecord>)  
  requires: animal exists  
  effects: return all birth records where this animal is the mother or father  

viewWeaning (birthRecord: BirthRecord): (record: WeaningRecord?)
  requires: birthRecord exists  
  effects: return the weaning record associated with this birth, if any 

updateBirthRecord (birthRecord: BirthRecord, birthDate: Date?, offspring: Set<Animal>?, countBorn: Number?, notes: String?)  
  requires: birthRecord exists  
  effects: update any provided fields in the birth record and leave the rest unchanged   
```

concept DataAnalysis \[Animal, Herd]\
purpose generate summaries, comparisons, and trends based on recorded animal and herd data\
principle\
a user selects an individual animal or herd to generate a report;\
queries performance records such as weight and growth rate;\
analyzes reproductive outcomes including offspring counts and survivability;\
and views aggregated results to support operational decisions.

state\
a set of GeneratedReports with\
a reportType Enum \[growth, reproduction, herd composition]\
a dateGenerated Date\
a target Animal or Herd
a set of metrics Enum \[weight, rateOfGain, offspringPerBirth, weaningRate]\
a summary String\
a set of results (key-value pairs or tabular data)

actions\
generateReport (user: User, reportType: Enum, filters: Set<Filter>, metrics: Set<Enum>): (report: GeneratedReport)\
effects: produce a report based on the specified parameters and store the results

```
viewReport (report: GeneratedReport): (summary: String, results: GeneratedReport)  
  requires: report exists  
  effects: return the summary and results of the report  

listReports (): (reports: Set<GeneratedReport>)  
  effects: return all generated reports  

deleteReport (report: GeneratedReport)  
  requires: report exists and belongs to the user  
  effects: remove the report from the system  
```

sync recordBirth\
when AnimalIdentity.RegisterAnimal(owner: User, tag: String, species: String, breed: String, birthDate: Date, sex: Enum, mother)\
then ReproductiveRecords.recordBirth(mother: Animal, father: Animal?, birthDate: Date, offspring: Set<Animal>, countBorn: Number, notes: String?) or ReproductiveRecords.updateBirthRecord (mother: Animal?, father: Animal?, birthDate: Date, offspring: Set<Animal>, countBorn: Number, notes: String?)

Create a birth record if there is one or add the animal to the birth record if there is one

sync viewGrowth\
when DataAnalysis.generateReport (animal, reportType: growth)\
then GrowthRecords.viewGrowth (animal)
