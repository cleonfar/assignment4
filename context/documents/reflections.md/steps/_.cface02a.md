# Reflections

0. General thoughts

* Overall I think I learned a lot in the process of creating this app. This was my first experience with really diving into creating a full app from scratch, so I didn't know exactly what to expect going into it. I think it was certainly more time consuming that I would have expected, which caused me some stress at times, but it was also one of the best learning experiences I think I've had so far at MIT, because it gave me the opportunity to really explore the software development process in a more real way than a lot of classes, with a problem that I knew and was interested in.

1. Struggles

* For me the hardest was planning out concepts. In class it always seemed easy from the examples to draw clear lines between concepts and see what functionality fit where. In practice though, I had some difficulty identifying clear boundaries between concepts so that they were independent of each other but only contained functionality for that concept. I spent a good bit of time discussing this with an LLM to try to work out the best approach, and even now I'm not fully convinced I reached the best possible design, but I'm overall happy with what I came up with. This is a skill that I feel I've developed a lot through this assignment, but will still need to continue to work on in the future.

* Another difficulty I had was iterating with context on the construction of my backend. Especially for the implementation of the first concept there was a lot I had to learn about what to tell it and how to communicate issues with it in a way that it would understand and correctly fix them. I also learned that if I were to develop code with context or a similar tool in the future I would probably start with the least complicated concept instead of the most complicated one, which in hindsight probably should have been obvious, but I think instead I just picked a concept to start with at random and then got stuborn and dug in my heels until I figured out how to get context to make it work correctly.

2. Use of AI

* Despite some of my frustrations with it I used the context tool extensively in writing the backend code and test cases, and I found it invaluable. It was able to create code so much faster than I could have on my own. As a result I was able to implement most of the features that I wanted to, which timewise would have been completely impossible for me otherwise. Similarly, I used an agentic tool on the frontend, and it really saved the app. I have almost zero experience with HTML or css outside of this class, so without the agentic coding tool I would have had to dedicate a much larger amount of time to learning HTML and css to try to put something together. Instead I only had to learn the basics so I could oversee the code the agentic tool was creating for me, allowing me to work much faster and focus more on designing the frontend as well as I could. It was also great for me because I didn't have a clear idea in mind for what the frontend should look like, and I prefer changing and figuring things out as I go rather than having everything planned out ahead of time, and with the agentic tool I was able to give it somewhat vague instructions like "make a home page" and then work of of what it had come up with to refine it into something I was happy with. Based on my experience with the AI tools, I think an appropriate use of LLMs in software development would be to guide them towards your desired outcome, working incrementally and iteratively with them to ensure each feature is working properly.
