# Updated Design

1. The major change that I made to the design of the backend was the addition of a simple user authentification concept. I set it up so that the app could support multiple users without causing their information to overlap. This caused a change to most of the other concepts so that their actions and queries required a username as input so that they would only interact with animals that belonged to them.

2. There were a number of minor changes to the actions and queries of concepts as I realized what I needed or didn't need, but I don't think that there was anything major that changed the overall purpose of the concept, just minor correctness issues that were fixed.
