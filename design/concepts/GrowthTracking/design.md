# Design Changes  
1. This concept is sort of a combination of two concepts from my original design. In the original design, I had concepts for animal growth records, animal reproductive records, and for data analysis. Originally I had intended to merge the two records concepts into one, but since the data analysis concept would rely on the records from the record keeping concept I didn't see a way to implement the concepts without any knowledge of each other. Eventually I decided to go this route, with concepts for reproduction tracking and growth tracking that both inherited some of the functionality from the dataAnalysis concept.  

2. Other than that fairly large change, nothing else really changed with this concept.
