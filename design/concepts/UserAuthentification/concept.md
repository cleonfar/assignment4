**concept** UserAuthentication \[User]

**purpose** Verify a user's identity to grant or deny access to a web account.

**state**
  a set of Users with
    a username String
    a password String

**actions**

  register (username: String, password: String): (user: User)
    **requires** there is no User 'u' in the set of Users whose username is 'username'
    **effects**
      create a new User entity
      associate 'username' with this new User
      associate 'password' with this new User
      returns the new User entity

  login (username: String, password: String): (user: String)
    **requires**
      there exists a User 'u' such that u's username is 'username' AND u's password is 'password'
    **effects** Returns the user's username.
