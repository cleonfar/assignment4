# Design Changes  
This concept is sort of a combination of two concepts from my original design. In the original design, I had concepts for animal growth records, animal reproductive records, and for data analysis. Originally I had intended to merge the two records concepts into one, but since the data analysis concept would rely on the records from the record keeping concept I didn't see a way to implement the concepts without any knowledge of each other. Eventually I decided to go this route, with concepts for reproduction tracking and growth tracking that both inherited some of the functionality from the dataAnalysis concept.  

The state also changed dramatically, potentially holding a lot more information. This was done most to allow me to build the reports with all the information I wanted, and to be set up for possibly adding some other functionality that I've considered as well but didn't feel needed to be added at the moment. Also, some of the input and output for actions was modified slightly to make sure they were limited to primitives.
