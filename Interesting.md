1. Realized that concepts can't rely on input of more complex types than primitives, so I need to rework the record keeping and data analysis concepts. I discussed with the AI my concerns, and it was somewhat helpful in guiding me towards a design choice that I think I'm quite happy with.

2. This is a thoughts summary that I copy/pasted and saved from the terminal that I thought was interesting because for some reason it gave around 1500 lines of thought in the thought summary, including pretty much all of the code it was writing. I hadn't seen it do this before or after, and it seems kind of bizarre to me.

3. I don't exactly know if this is the best way to link to it, but this was a case where the AI was behaving very poorly. I went back and forth with it for a long time trying to get it to understand and fix some issue that I was having. It stood out to me as interesting for how riduculusly long it took for the AI to get there.

4. This was interesting to me because it was a really good result from the AI. I asked it to write the test suite for the Grouping concept in one shot not at all expecting it to work, but it managed to do it with only very minimal errors.

5. I spent a lot of time working with the AI on the ReproductionTracking concept, so I wasn't really looking forward to doing the GrowthTracking concept, since the two have some similarities and I was expecting a similar struggle. This concern was originally made much worse by the first attept by the AI having more code underlined in red than not. I was then pleasantly surprised by the AI returning almost completely correct code when I retried with the same prompt.
